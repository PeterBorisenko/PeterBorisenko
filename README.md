### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Peter
I am currently working on *Power management unit* and *Flight computer* for multipurpose UAV.
I use RTEMS RTOS and F-prime framework.
It's kinda challenging and requires many skills to get well optimised and safe solution.
But it is also a fun. Because everyone loves challenges!
