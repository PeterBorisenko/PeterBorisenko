### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PeterBorisenko
I am currently working on a *Power management system* and a *Flight computer* for a multipurpose drone.
I use RTEMS and F-prime systems.
It's kinda challenging and require many skills to get well optimised and safe solution.
But it is also a fun. Because everyone loves challnges!
